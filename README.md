## Lessons Learned

**System Design** refers to the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It encompasses both high-level design (HLDD) and detailed design (LLDD) phases and is crucial in software engineering to ensure that a system is robust, scalable, maintainable, and efficient.

**_Use Case_**

A use case is a description of a systemâ€™s behavior as it responds to a request that originates from outside of that system. It defines the interactions between a role (known in UML as an "actor") and the system to achieve a goal. Use cases are a powerful technique for capturing functional requirements and ensuring that all possible scenarios are considered in the design process.
